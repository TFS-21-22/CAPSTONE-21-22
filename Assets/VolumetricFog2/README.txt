Demo Scenes
-----------
There's a demo scene which lets you quickly check if Volumetric Fog & Mist 2 is working correctly in your project.
Note: make sure you have Universal RP 7.2.0 or later installed from Package Manager and also a URP pipeline asset assigned to Graphics Settings.

Future updates
--------------

All our assets follow an incremental development process by which a few beta releases are published on our support forum (kronnect.com).
We encourage you to signup and engage our forum. The forum is the primary support and feature discussions medium.

Of course, all updates of Volumetric Fog & Mist will be eventually available on the Asset Store.
